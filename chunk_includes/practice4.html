How do you know whether a sentence fragment is grammatical? Grammatical sentences sound like natural English---you might imagine a friend or colleague starting a sentence that way. For example, "this one girl is..." is a sentence that many speakers find grammatical. If the sentence contains a clear error that you don't think any English speaker would make, that is ungrammatical. An example of an ungrammatical sentence fragment in English is "this one girl are...", because for most speakers "are" can't be used with "this one girl".

We are not interested in whether an English professor would think the sentence is good. We are more interested in how native English speakers speak in day-to-day conversation.
